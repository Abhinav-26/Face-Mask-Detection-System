# Face-Mask-Detection-System
In this Repository I have uploaded Mask Detection System using Python3 and concepts of Transfer Learning and fine tuning. For Creating this detector I used the pre-trained model <b>inception_v3</b> which is provided by Google.

# How to Run Application
1. Setup DeepLearning Environment<br>
2. Install Packages Used <br>
3. Train Your Model<br>
4. A new weight will be saved, download it<br>
5. Run MaskDetection.py for real-time detection

NOTE: <b>Some of the minor Changes are still yet to be done</b>
